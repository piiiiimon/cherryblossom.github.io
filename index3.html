            <p> I lied...</p>

            <p>because I cannot seem to shake you off my mind
                When I try to take it away, it just keeps coming back. Stronger evrytime.
                Youve got something that keeps me attracted to you.
                A factor that makes me want to know you more.
                Though I dont know how to prove it wholely.
                I dont know how to say it in better words.
                I can only guess that words are still not enough to describe you.
                You're out of my league
                But that won't scare me away.
                Still Im going to try saying my thoughts into words.
                Im going to try.</p>

            <p>The presence of you.
                The you that always runs magic circles in my head.
                The you that always makes my heart warm.
                The you I knew as time passed by.
                The you that lights me up brighter each moment we spend. </p>

            <p>The pretty you.
                The brown tinge produced by your hair as the rays of the sun strike against it.
                The way your hair falls on your shoulders.
                Your rotund (chubbbby) cheeks and the way they bring your lips that curve a faint but charming smile.
                Your deep alluring eyes that hue umber to onyx as they line across mine.
                The shape of your body, your height, and the way you move.</p>

            <p>The attitude of you.
                The way you make the hardest things look indifferent,
                making unlikely pairs blend in perfectly together:
                Your simplicity and your unpredictable personality.
                Your gracefulness and your clumsiness.
                Your laziness and your diligence.
                Your vagueness and clarity.
                You always seem to blend night into day.
                The epitome of every personality.
                The way you make the small things look a little out of ordinary.
            </p>

            <p>Everthing about you, I fell for them all.
                Youre beautiful as far a my heart and eyes could see.
                Thats the reason why I find ways to compliment you every now and then.
                Though I know that every compliment I tell you is not enough,
                because youre not as simple as others want you to be, But youre as simple as you want yourself to be.
                You should know how words still cannot describe your mystique, your beauty. </p>

            <p>I said Im going to try.
                So I wrote this message beforehand, hoping you'd read it.
                If you do read this I want you to read the next lines out loud.</p>


            <p>You have me wondering how we are under the same sky when the stars we see are so different.</p>
