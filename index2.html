            <h2> To The Moon</h2>
            <p> I wanted to take you with me,
                To see the beauty beyond ground.
                But I guess you weren't ready.
                Yes, you didn't feel the same with me around. </p>

            <p>You disagreed without even trying.
                It's unfair, that's the point of rejection.
                Although, I couldn't do anything.
                I wasn't worth your attention. </p>

            <p>On my own, I boarded the ship.
                When I landed on the moon,
                I still felt incomplete.
                Why did I have to leave so soon?</p>

            <p>I thought I had to be the better one.
                Though you were far away, I still tried
                I still shouted to you from the moon,
                Thinking you'd hear me on the other side.</p>

            <p>Guess I was the crazy one.</p>

            <p>So, I sat down, as uncertain as I could be,
                Then I saw the brightest star I could ever see.
                Among the stars, this Star remains true;
                That is the love I have for you. </p>

            <p>Now I know where to begin.
                To start to accept and improve.
                And if I return, maybe I'll ask you again
                To come with me to the Moon. </p>
