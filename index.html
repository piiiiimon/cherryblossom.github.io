            <h2> Lovely, Little, You</h2>
            <p> I love you not because I think you're good for me, nor because you're the perfect blend of rights and wrongs. I love you not because I expect you to return the favor, I don't. </p>


            <p>I love you because you're the one I didn't see but hoped for. You make me feel free to loose out my feelings. The reason why I sometimes ignore the troubles of being uncomfortable. </p>

            <p> You always have me at my hearts efforts and wits. You make me wonder what love really is. </p>

            <p>The one who made me believe everything I have ever questioned about love.
                You make me wonder what you mean to me.
                Running circles around my mind every night, the reason why I lie in bed, but don't want to sleep at night. </p>

            <p>I can't seem to shake you off my head.
                I guess I'm impossibly and inescapably attracted to you. You the simple portrait more beautiful than any art. And I love you for that, I guess I still do. </p>

            <p>"I want to be good for you, and say and do all the right things, and be everything you have been looking for because I want you to love me." </p>
